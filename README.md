# URL Shortener with IP and Location Tracking

## Introduction

This project is a URL shortener application that allows you to create short, easy-to-share links from long URLs. In addition to shortening URLs, the system has the capability to track information about users who access the shortened links, including:

- **IP Address** of the visitor.
- **Geolocation** based on the IP (including country, city, and other location details).
- **Access Timestamp**: View when each link was accessed.

## Key Features

- **URL Shortening**: Convert long URLs into short, shareable links.
- **IP Tracking**: Record the IP address of users accessing the shortened URLs.
- **Geolocation Tracking**: Identify the visitor's location based on their IP using an IP geolocation service.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: View access statistics, including IP, location, and time of access for each shortened URL.

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js & Express**: Build the API and handle server-side requests.
- **MongoDB**: Store original URLs, shortened URLs, and tracking data.
- **GeoIP Service (e.g., IP-API or MaxMind)**: Determine the geolocation based on visitors' IP addresses.
- **Puppeteer**: (Optional) For web scraping if required.
